# low-level-experiments
Experiments for learning C++ development in Linux.

The purpose of this repo is to document code and learnings as I dive into advanced C++ topics and writing highly optimized low-level code. I want to gain practice benchmarking, identifying bottlenecks, making hypotheses, testing optimizations, and ultimately building this up to writing highly performant systems using the lessons learned. I plan to record as much as I can for my own learning and in case this is helpful to anyone else.
